Performer,"Performer is a PCN <I>Globodera Pallida </I>resistant and tolerant processing variety. Field trials conducted over many years have consistently shown that Performer significantly reduces the population of <I>G. Pallida </I> in the soil, whilst producing a good yield, even when untreated with nematicide. The variety is gaining popularity as a tasty chipper in the fish & chip shop market. It has a brown (russet) skin and a pale yellow flesh colour, and due to its superb uniformity of shape with big, oval long tubers, it is ideally suited for processing. With a floury texture, Performer also eats well as a baker. Although tuber numbers can be lower than other varieties, its marketable yield is very high with low wastage, producing big, bold tubers of 45mm upwards. It has a good dry matter content and is well suited for long term storage. This is a strong plant with a very good rooting system and consequently can be cultivated on most soil types but is a little susceptible to Common Scab. Performer is suitable for growing in Western Europe.  The variety has high resistance to PVYN.","Nika x Innovator",1,Agrico,.,.,.,.,.,AUSTRIA,,,,,"Agrico UK Ltd","Castleton of Eassie",,"By Forfar",Angus,"DD8 1SJ","UNITED KINGDOM",potatoes@agrico.co.uk,www.agrico.co.uk,"+44 (0)1307 840551","+44 (0)1307 840245",-,"Oval - long",Russet,"Light yellow","Very shallow - shallow",Rough,-,Maincrop,"Very tall",White,-,5,5,-,-,-,6,-,8,4,7,1,3,7,5,5,7,5,2,3,Long,22%,-,Fluffy
