      <p class="govuk-body">If you have a large amount of a commodity and plan to export it using multiple phytosanitary certificates, you can apply for one time testing.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">One time testing means you can make multiple phytosanitary applications without having to test repeatedly. The commodity you test must already be in your possession. You can re-use the sample test results to apply for phytosanitary certificates until the commodity in your possession is used up.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 1.</strong> Set up one time testing and send off your samples to the plant clinic. Wait for your test results to come back.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once your test results come back, you can start making phytosanitary certificate applications. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You must wait for your results to come back from the plant clinic before you can apply for a phytosanitary certificate.</p>
