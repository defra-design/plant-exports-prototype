      <li>We'll send a confirmation email to your email address. The email will contain a link to the terms and conditions.</li>
      <li>When everyone involved in PHEATS has accepted the terms and conditions, the inspector will arrange your training.</li>
      <li>The inspector will also do an initial site inspection. This usually takes around 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Once you've completed these steps, your organisation will be fully registered for PHEATS. You'll then be able to start doing your own inspections.</li>
