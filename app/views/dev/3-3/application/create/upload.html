            If some of the packages in your consignment have different places of origin, you must add them as separate rows.
            <br><br>
            For example, if 5 packages of your commodity come from France and Italy, and 3 packages come from Germany. In this case add the details for the 5 packages in one row. You will add FR as country code for country of origin 1 and IT as country code for country of origin 2. Add another row for the 3 from Germany. In this row the country code for country of origin 1 will be DE.
