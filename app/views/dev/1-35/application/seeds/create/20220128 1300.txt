Business?
supply B&Q, morrisons

fruit trees, bedding plants to NI 
plan to export to Rep Ireland

bulbs, everything, herbs as well
a big range of gardening plants

[have to send separate phyto for bulbs?]
just send one  - actually bulbs are potted uyp as a finished product
work with inspectors to apply using one phyto
don't want any issues at the border
our customers are aware of the issue exporting

using new system - nice and easy to use
only issue is the new template for upload
if you need to inspect at border it is an issue
if you need to print out list

EPPO depends on plant type - haven't used EPPO - only used this twice for the new system
Packaging type and material isn't actual how it is packaged and can't change it from one of the default items
eg 6 pack of items or pots - pots are fine - its extra work to add the packaging to the upload - eg wrapping packaging - isn't clear so leave blank
eg 4-pack, 6-pack for each item and then relate to the actual consignment at the border

Genus and species was one column with species in brackets and so now need to split. It doesn't look pretty

We run our database and need to add in new fields,
Had to add in lines manually and wouldn't want to do that again

One issue - created file last week - first went through - got error with last one - had to resave the file again and it went through

couldn't see all the items from the upload - only 15-20 visible from 68 lines uploaded

usually eg more than 100 items - when it is quiet, 58 items
eg primrose red, primrose, blue etc line for each colour

[Do they make changes?]
(have their own) internal rules - not changing anything - it must be 100%
if inspectors are not happy, they need to issue new phyto

upload one day and inspected next day - I don't want to add it (cahnge lines) manually as I neeed to change my other spreadsheets - would delete uploaded and reload to match delivery notes, packing list etc

Never use samples
avoid doing any other export to other country

[Expt page - guidance notes]
If you want to do it (export) you should read the guidance notes

[Optional columns?]
with plant inspector - needs genus and species in order to inspect and know what to send
I had great support from inspectors at this end - how to uplaod etc - a few mins to read thru and everything fine for us

[Any Advice?] you should be well aware of what you are doing - what you have there is enough

[bulbs] our bulbs are finished product, in pot with compost
so not dry bulb

[dashboard] I am happy with the improvement cf previous - I don't go back, I start a new one - I'm alright

Instant performance - I can't complain

I'm not unhappy but need to comply with regs

not seen XI ref for NI

Created new application each time to avoid errors - to make sure phyto is accurate
