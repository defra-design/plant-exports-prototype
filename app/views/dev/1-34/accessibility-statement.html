              <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-4">This service was last tested on 19 March 2021. The test was carried out by Prolifics Testing using both manual and automated test techniques to assess compliance against the desired AA rating against the WCAG 2.1 standard for accessibility. Manual checks included keyboard navigation, page zoom, contrast and high contrast / reverse mode, to simulate users relying on assistive technologies to access the pages within scope. Tests were carried out on Windows and Mac machines. Tools that were used include
